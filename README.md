# PBS KIDS Video JS Barebones Test Harness

## Setup

Install dependencies!

`npm ci`

Then, usually, just open `./public/index.html` in a browser.

However, on some browsers, such as Safari on Mac, there are issues that can be resolved by opening the html file from a local server, which is included in this package. Just run `npm start`. The link to your server will be provided in the terminal output.

## Auto-Deployment to AMP

_Update May 2024: This project is no longer being auto-deployed to AMP. Apparently that was broken at some point. May circle back to this later._

~~Commits to the `main` branch of this project trigger an auto-deploy to: <https://pbs-kids-video-js-test-harness.playground.pbskids.org/>.~~
