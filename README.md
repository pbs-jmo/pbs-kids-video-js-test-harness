# PBS KIDS Video JS Barebones Test Harness

## Setup

Install dependencies!

`npm ci`

Then, usually, just open `./public/index.html` in a browser.

However, on some browsers, such as Safari on Mac, there are issues that can be resolved by opening the html file from a local server, which is included in this package. Just run `npm start`. The link to your server will be provided in the terminal output.
